excerpt: "We examine the unique format of the Istanbul Flower Auction and compare it to traditional Dutch and English auctions, emphasizing the need to auction large volumes rapidly. In a model with time costs, we study how this auction format, which cleverly combines Dutch and English auction mechanisms, manages time costs by dynamically adapting to initial bidding behaviors. Our numerical analysis considers specific time cost functions and reveals the high performance of the Istanbul Flower Auction in comparison to standard auction formats, in terms of both auctioneer and bidder utilities. This work highlights the critical role of auction design in improving social welfare, particularly in scenarios demanding the quick sale of numerous lots."

__Abstract:__ We examine a unique auction format used in the Istanbul flower market, which could transform into either Dutch or English auction depending on bidders' bidding behaviors. By introducing a time cost that reduces the value of a perishable good as time passes, we explore how this hybrid auction format accommodates the desire for speed via an adaptive starting price. We show that the Istanbul Flower Auction outperforms both the Dutch and English auctions in terms of the auctioneer's utility. With numerical analysis, we also illustrate the Istanbul Flower Auction's superiority in terms of social welfare and auction duration. Our results highlight the critical role of auction design in improving welfare when the duration of the auction process plays a role.
