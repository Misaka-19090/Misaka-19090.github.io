excerpt: "We examine the unique format of the Istanbul Flower Auction and compare it to traditional Dutch and English auctions, emphasizing the need to auction large volumes rapidly. In a model with time costs, we study how this auction format, which cleverly combines Dutch and English auction mechanisms, manages time costs by dynamically adapting to initial bidding behaviors. Our numerical analysis considers specific time cost functions and reveals the high performance of the Istanbul Flower Auction in comparison to standard auction formats, in terms of both auctioneer and bidder utilities. This work highlights the critical role of auction design in improving social welfare, particularly in scenarios demanding the quick sale of numerous lots."

__Abstract:__ We examine the unique format of the Istanbul Flower Auction and compare it to traditional Dutch and English auctions, emphasizing the need to auction large volumes rapidly. In a model with time costs, we study how this auction format, which cleverly combines Dutch and English auction mechanisms, manages time costs by dynamically adapting to initial bidding behaviors. Our numerical analysis considers specific time cost functions and reveals the high performance of the Istanbul Flower Auction in comparison to standard auction formats, in terms of both auctioneer and bidder utilities. This work highlights the critical role of auction design in improving social welfare, particularly in scenarios demanding the quick sale of numerous lots.
