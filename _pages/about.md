## About me

I am a junior economic researcher. I obtained a PhD in Economics degree at the University of Technology Sydney in 2024. My research focus on introducing behavioural features inspired by the real-world market environmental settings into microeconomic models, comparing the performance of different mechanisms that could be implemented, providing solid evidence---both analytically and empirically---for the favour of certain mechanism when specific contextual features need to be emphasised in practice, offering insights that could inform the design and selection of mechanisms and shed light on the improvement of market efficiency and participant welfare. My current work focuses on hybrid auctions with time costs. I am also experienced in experimental design and laboratory management.
